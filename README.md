# AlphaCare Car Insurance Analytics Challenge

##  Project Overview

This project is part of a marketing analytics challenge at **AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)**. The objective is to analyze car insurance claim data in South Africa to uncover patterns in risk and profitability, optimize marketing strategy, and identify low-risk customer segments eligible for premium reductions.

## ðŸ“Š Business Objectives

- Perform A/B hypothesis testing to validate assumptions on risk and profit variations.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and detect patterns.
- Build statistical and machine learning models to:
  - Predict total claims based on features.
  - Recommend optimal premium values based on risk levels.
